# hello-world
sandbox repository!
Hi I'm Addie, this is my first repository, so I am just following the guide and writing some info about myself.
I have really enjoyed coding in the past and I am hoping to continue learning and improving my skills as a coder!
Thank you to all who read! I hope you are having a wonderful day.
